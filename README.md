# About the Project
The main goal of this project was to explore the relationship between the consumption of non-renewable energy and prevalence of respiratory diseases, especially asthma. The ultimate aim was to prove the causality: The more non-renewable energy consumed, the higher prevelance of asthma.

# Methodolgy
* The following relationships were carefully examined: 
  * causality between renewable energy source consumption and air quality
  * causality between air quality and asthma rates
  * causality between renewable energy consumption and reduction in toxic air components
  * causality between air components and air quality
* Applied Panel Regression, Breusch-Pagan test, the Hausman test, and the Granger Causality test

<em>The analysis and the 12-page-long research paper was completed in a limit of 8 hours. </em>

# About The Data Open
The Data Open is a datathon competition taking place throughout the year at a series of top universities. At each event, participants work in teams to work through a large and complex dataset and then present their findings to a panel of judges. <br />
