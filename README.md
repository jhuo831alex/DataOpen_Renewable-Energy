# About the project
The main goal of this project was to explore the relationship between the consumption of non-renewable energy and prevalence of respiratory diseases, especially asthma. The ultimate aim is to prove the causality between consumption of non-renewable energy and asthma rates. 

# Methodolgy
* The following relationships were carefully examined: 
  * causality between renewable energy source consumption and air quality
  * causality between air quality and asthma rates
  * causality between renewable energy consumption and reduction in toxic air components
  * causality between air components and air quality
* Applied Panel Regression, Breusch-Pagan test, the Hausman test, and the Granger Causality test

The analysis was done, and the paper was written in a limit of 8 hours.
